<p>Don&rsquo;t run away just yet, we&#8217;re really nice people (and we&rsquo;ll give you cake).</p>

<ol>
<li>Do ask if you need help, although it might be worth having a quick google first for the information.  Our <a href="http://trac.studentrobotics.org">wiki</a> contains an awful lot of information.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;ve never used a revision control system before (or don&rsquo;t even know what that means) please ask someone about git, we use it to store nearly everything we do.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be scared to ask things.</li>
<li>Fill the list with all your SR related thoughts, we love information.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid of looking silly. We&rsquo;ve all done it within SR at one point.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="foroldsrmembers">For Old SR Members</h2>

<p>Don&rsquo;t bite the newbies, these people think we&rsquo;re doing cool stuff, let&rsquo;s not scare them away just yet.

<ol>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use specialised terms unless you&rsquo;re sure the Newbie is familiar with the term. Examples are &lsquo;BOM&rsquo;, &lsquo;Gerbers&rsquo;, &lsquo;Geda&rsquo; and &lsquo;PWM&rsquo; (depending on what background they come from). Do: ask them if they know what a &lsquo;BOM&rsquo; is and then if they don&rsquo;t tell them.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t assume they know what they&rsquo;re doing, <em>especially</em> if they say that they know what they&rsquo;re doing. Do: check on their progress, help them get their progress to others using git.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t mercilessly critique their work in the same way you would the IDE, something Rob or Rich has made or jump in and change it for them. Do: try to be constructive in criticism, review things with them at the same time that they&rsquo;re doing them.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t give them a task and then leave them on their own to do it. Do: walk through everything they need help with, face to face, for at least a few months. (yes Months).</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t ask them to google it, link them to google, or send them to just fucking google it unless you&rsquo;ve repeatedly beaten the thing that they&rsquo;re trying to do a thousand times.</li>
</ol>
